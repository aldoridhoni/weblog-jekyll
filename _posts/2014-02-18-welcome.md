## New theme New feel

It's time to introducing new theme for this blog, static and minimalistic blog.

## What I use

I use jekyll with flex theme. Credit to creator.
Jekyll can be found at [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/‎).

## WebGL

Add simple 3d object using webgl and three.js library for easy scripting.
three.js site at [treejs.org](http://treejs.org)

I hope you like the new feel for the site, cause i'm pretty exited editing this.

xx.
