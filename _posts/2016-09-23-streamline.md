![Talk Screenshot](/public/images/2016/09/23/screenshot.png)

There is a great talk from Jesse Jiryu about writing [excellent programming blog](https://emptysqua.re/blog/the-write-an-excellent-programming-blog-page/).
If you have a blog, you should probably watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHXq-IzlGUE). I, myself try to internalize his talk slowly by refreshing the looks of this blog.

My Weblog will now be categorize in :

- [Story](/story)
- [Opinion](/opinion)
- [How-To](/how-to)
- [How Things Work](/how-things-work)
- [Review](/review)

(click to go to the corresponding category)

My other more technical blog on [blogger](http://scx020c06a.blogspot.co.id/) now will be deprecated and I will focus on writing things in here.
